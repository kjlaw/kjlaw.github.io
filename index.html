<h3>Hackathon Projects</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kjlaw/InternHackday2016">Kinetic Connection</a> - An Android app that allows users to “kinetically connect” with people on LinkedIn in augmented reality. Created using a customized camera interface and a face recognition API from Kairos to display an overlay over the person’s face with their name and title, and a button that deep-links into their profile within the native LinkedIn app.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kjlaw/Smile">Sm:)e</a> - An Android app that helps users keep their mental health in check by analyzing the tone of recent texts, keeping track of their mood, and promoting auditory and visual relaxation. Utilized Android's Telephony provider and IBM Watson's Tone Analyzer to obtain emotional, writing, and social tones for the user's texts.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kjlaw/Wayst">Wayst</a> - A haptic feedback waist accessory that provides navigation assistance via proximity sensors and a companion Android app. Android app utilizes the Google Maps Directions API and the Particle Android Cloud SDK to provide navigation information to the Particle Core in the belt.</p>
<p><a href="http://devpost.com/software/uber-prepared">UberPrepared</a> - An Uber pre-order/scheduling service that works via SMS or a native Android app. Developed with the Uber, Twilio, and Google Places APIs, a finite state machine, and some natural language processing techniques to allow users to fuzzy search pick-up and drop-off locations and select a pick-up time. Implemented the backend using Node.js, ExpressJS, and MongoDB.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kjlaw/PebbleCaltrain">Wake Me Up</a> - A Pebble app, developed in C, and a companion Android app that wakes a user from their nap while taking public transportation. Uses Google Play services location APIs to track the user’s location and wake them before they reach their stop.</p> 
<p><a href="https://github.com/kjlaw/MHacks_IV">OZBOT</a> - OZBOT is a web app developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that takes young girls through the story of The Wizard of Oz and teaches them about various aspects of robotics along the way. The end of the current app is a springboard for our next project, where we hope to turn "Oz" into a digital workspace that allows simple robot assembly and very basic CAD and programming exposure. This workspace would enable girls to design their own robots and give them the option to purchase their custom kit of parts to build the robot at home</p>

<h3>Website Projects</h3>
<p><a href="http://kashdevelopment.com/">Kash Development, LLC</a> - Kash Development, LLC is a family-owned business that provides rental homes in East Lansing, Michigan. The purpose of this website is to make it easy for people to locate the properties and find out information about them. I decided to add all of the properties to a Google map, so potential renters can locate them easily and get directions if necessary.  I also created a photo album and an information list for each property.  The website also features downloadable lease documents and a conveniently placed phone number in the header.</p>
<p><a href="http://kjlaw.github.io/HEAT_Tennis_Academy/">H.E.A.T. Tennis Academy</a> - H.E.A.T. Tennis Academy offers summer camps and practice sessions for tennis players of all levels.  The purpose of this website is for players to have a convenient way to access information about the coaching staff, schedule, tuition, location, and announcements.  I used an interactive map that displays the academy’s location with current weather information at that location.  I also added a Twitter feed to display schedule and location changes due to weather.  Using Adobe Flash, I customized a Flash template and added it to the intro page as requested.  I also set up social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter for this academy and designed promotional brochures.</p>
<p><a href="http://kjlaw.github.io/FIRST_in_Michigan/">FIRST in Michigan</a> - FIRST in Michigan is a non-profit organization that oversees all the FIRST robotics competitions in Michigan. I started working on this website in 2010, adding new components and features over the years. Working closely with the board of directors, I designed the FIRST in Michigan logo based on the US FIRST logo.  The color scheme of this website also follows the US FIRST color scheme. This website contains information for all levels of robotics competition, from Kindergarteners building LEGO robots to high school students building robots weighing over 100 pounds.  This website displays all the events in Michigan and information relating to these events. It also has an interactive map that displays all the FIRST robotics teams in Michigan.</p>
<p><a href="http://kjlaw.github.io/Destination_STEM/">Destination STEM</a> - Destination STEM is a non-profit organization that offers free summer camps to young girls with the purpose of increasing their interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). I designed a logo for this organization, and I selected an appropriate color scheme. This website displays camp information, schedules, and downloadable application forms. Also featured on this website are videos that I created using previous years’ pictures and video clips. In addition, I created a sponsors page to display the sponsors and link to their websites.</p>
<p><a href="http://kjlaw.github.io/AmericanGov/">Educational website</a> - I created this website for a teacher to make learning about the American government fun for early elementary school students.  This website features interactive graphics that “pop-up” to reveal more information about certain topics. Students are also able to download activities and homework assignments from the website.  Phillip Martin’s artwork was used extensively to create this site.</p>
<p><a href="http://kjlaw.github.io/Team_2834_2012/">Bionic Barons Robotics</a> - I created this website for the Bionic Barons, Andover High School’s robotics team. The main purpose of this website is to generate interest in the community and to promote STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).  A medieval theme was chosen for this website since it is the home of the barons. Graphics and animations are used throughout this website to make it appealing to younger kids. Malathar’s dragons were animated using Photoshop, and a customized Google map is also displayed on the website. prettyPhoto was used to display pop up videos on certain pages. The banners on the side feature quick links to the US FIRST robotics website, the FIRST robotics in Michigan website, and the websites of the team’s major sponsors.</p>
<p><a href="http://kjlaw.me/klportfolio/AndoverGolf/index.html">Andover High School Golf</a> - I created this website for the Andover High School golf team’s 2011 season.  The purpose of this website was to generate interest in the school and community, and to display the coaches’ contact information. It also featured a photo gallery where visitors could view and download pictures.</p>
<p><a href="http://kjlaw.github.io/AndoverTennis/">Andover High School Tennis</a> - I created this website for the Andover High School tennis team’s 2011 season. This website was an important resource for team members and the school community to check match schedules and results.  It also displayed the team’s Twitter feed to update team members on announcements and last-minute schedule changes.</p>
<p>Express Billing Services - Express Billing and Consulting Services Inc. is a small family-owned medical billing service in SE Michigan. They wanted to establish an online presence and a way for potential clients to easily contact them.  This website features an online contact form for queries from potential clients. I also worked with this company to design their promotional material.</p>             	
<p>Armand Molino Tennis - I built this website in 2009 for Armand Molino, a tennis coach in SE Michigan.  Coach Molino wanted a website where he could direct people looking for more information about his background and his summer camps. This website ended up serving multiple purposes.  It became a place where campers can go for the schedule, camp news, and announcements.  It also displays a Twitter feed containing information about rain delays and last-minute schedule changes.  In addition, this website is host to Molino’s summer camp photo archives where campers can view previous years’ camp pictures, and a hall of fame displaying the names of his students who were tournament winners.  I also worked with Coach Molino to design camp brochures and t-shirt designs for his summer camps.</p>
